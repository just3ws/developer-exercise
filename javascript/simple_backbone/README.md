Please provide the following functionality:

  and display the available information in a list-like structure (table/list)
- Provide client-side pagination (up to 15 quotes per page)
- Optionally: Provide a way to filter between game and movie quotes
- Optionally: Provide a client-side search that filters by the quote text
